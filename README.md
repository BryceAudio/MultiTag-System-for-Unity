# Group-System-for-Unity

This system will allow you to add your object to a group of similar objects, you can think of it as a multi-tag. Also, this system allows you to get from any group random objects or even get the whole group and put in an list.

## Requirements
[NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes) for some attributes (not necessary, you can just remove the extra attributes).

Patience to read my bad English

## Performance
I did some performance testing. My group check works a little faster in most cases, it also removes the need to work with strings, allows you to check the object for a lot of "tags" and a few other interesting things.

Test with 1000 of GameObjects and 100 000 of iterations 
 
Tag check performance = ~62 FPS & ~14 Self MS

Group check performance = ~74 FPS & ~12.3 Self MS 

## Usage
Throw scripts from this repository into your project

### Group creation
You can create a group through the context menu in the project folder. This will create a ScriptableObject in your folder.

### Attach an object to a group/groups

Simply attach the "Member" script to the object you want to add to the desired groups.

### Examples

#### Example with getting all objects from the group.

Let's say you have in the game merchants of different races and you want to give the item called "Goblin dagger" only to merchants of Goblin race. 

We have such groups in the game and adding a dagger to Goblin merchants is very simple.

![Example00](https://i.gyazo.com/d66e91d567f7bc5d9ac2bd7a9f7e2043.png)

Add a "GiveItem" script to Goblin merchants.

![Example01](https://i.gyazo.com/49d96516a3f53a6fde6e695c3a1dad07.png)

And write some code

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class GiveItem : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField] private Group goblinMerchants;
	[SerializeField] private List<GameObjects> goblins = new List<GameObjects>();

	private void Start()
	{
		goblins = goblinMerchants.GetAllMembers();
		GiveItemToGoblinMerchants();
	}

	private void GiveItemToGoblinMerchants()
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < goblins.Count; i++)
		{
			// Give item to goblins
		}
	}
}

```

### Example with checking if the desired target is in the right groups.

Imagine that we have a bullet that can set ignite to enemies who are not immune to ignite. Instead of adding to our enemy components of immunity, such as immunity to ignite, cold and others. We can add this enemy in a group with the name "ImmuteToIgnite"

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BurningBullet : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField] private Vector3 bulletSpeed;
	[SerializeField] private Group immuneEnemies;

	private Transform myTransform;

	private void Update()
	{
		myTransform.position += bulletSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
	}

	private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider enemy)
	{
		// 2x Faster
		if (!immuneEnemies.HasMember(enemy.gameObject))
		{
			// Burn enemy
		}

		// 2x slower
		if (!enemy.GetComponent<ImmuneToIgnite>())
		{
			// Burn enemy
		}
	}
}

```
